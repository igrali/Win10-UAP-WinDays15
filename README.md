# Win10-UWP-AdaptiveSamples
Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform demos of new XAML adaptive capabilities and controls.
I use these to show the new features when presenting the topic at conferences.

>All demos are updated to work with Windows 10 10240 APIs.

The soluton consists of 5 projects:

####AdaptiveTriggers

* Shows a basic use of state triggers such as AdaptiveTrigger

####DeviceSpecificView 

* Shows how specific XAML views can be used for different platforms
* Uses both Page and UserControl

####RelativePanel

* Shows a basic use of RelativePanel

####SplitView

* Shows how SplitView can be used as navigation affordance
* Simple demo in which SplitView uses Frame as content

####WinDaysXV

* Demo which combines many of the previously mentioned features: state triggers, SplitView and RelativePanels
